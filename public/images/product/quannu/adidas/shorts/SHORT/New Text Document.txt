RUNNING SHORTS
RUNNING SHORTS MADE IN PART WITH RECYCLED MATERIALS.
Brighten up streets and sidewalks in these adidas running shorts, a collaboration with the Marimekko design studio. They have a bold flower print that celebrates women's empowerment and self-expression. The two-in-one shorts combine stretchy inner short tights with an outer shell for coverage you won't have to think about. AEROREADY manages your body's moisture to keep you dry and moving toward the finish.

Made with a series of recycled materials, and at least 60% recycled content, this product represents just one of our solutions to help end plastic waste.

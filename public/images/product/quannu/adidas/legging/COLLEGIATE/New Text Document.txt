COLLEGIATE LEGGINGS
LEGGINGS WITH SPORTY STYLE MADE IN PART WITH RECYCLED CONTENT.
What would we do without leggings? They always come through to keep us comfortable, whether we're relaxing or adventuring. These leggings also serve up serious style points with an adidas Badge of Sport logo and a sporty crop cut. Pair them with a favourite t-shirt, and get after the day.

Made in part with recycled content generated from production waste, e.g. cutting scraps, and post-consumer household waste to avoid the larger environmental impact of producing virgin content.

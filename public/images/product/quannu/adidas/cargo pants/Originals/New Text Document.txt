ADICOLOR CLASSICS TRACK PANTS
ONE HALF OF THE CLASSIC TRACK SUIT, WITH ALL OF THE COMFORT.
Rumour has it adidas introduced the track suit in '64. We won't confirm, but there's no question the 3-Stripes have spent decades standing out on fields, in stadiums, on streets and everywhere in between. No matter where you are, it somehow never looks out of place. These track pants are clear proof of that. All about ease and comfort, the soft fabric is made from Parley Ocean Plastic yarn that's sourced from upcycled plastic waste.

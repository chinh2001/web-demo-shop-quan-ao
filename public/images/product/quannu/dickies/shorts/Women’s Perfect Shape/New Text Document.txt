Women’s Perfect Shape
When it’s summer time but you still want a decent length to your bottoms, reach for Dickies Women’s Perfect Shape 11" Twill Bermuda Shorts. The 11” length lands close to the knee, but hitting just above so your knees aren’t restricted. The straight leg gives you a nice silhouette. A great amount of spandex and bi-stretch material keeps you moving any ways you need to with 360° movement, while the cotton part of it remains soft to the touch. A Flex tummy panel keeps you looking your best in the stomach region and overall will keep you confident throughout your day.

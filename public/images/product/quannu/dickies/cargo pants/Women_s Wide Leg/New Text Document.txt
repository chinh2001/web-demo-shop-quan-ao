Women's Wide Leg
Rooted in retro workwear styling from the Factory era of the 1940s and 1950s, the Women's Wide Leg Work Pants features archival fabrication with a modern silhouette to recapture the character of the American worker. As part of the Clean Utility Core Collection, these wide leg work pants offer straightforward styling in a stonewash for a softer hand feel. The contoured waistband ensures a flattering fit with a high rise that sits right under the navel, perfect to pair with the Relaxed Cropped Work Shirt from the same collection. Complete with a zip front and hook and eye closure, these flat front work pants provide added utility with front and back pockets. Staying true to the spirit of authentic workwear, the modern High Rise Work Pants are finished with a clean hem and Dickies traditional tricolor logo on the right back pocket.

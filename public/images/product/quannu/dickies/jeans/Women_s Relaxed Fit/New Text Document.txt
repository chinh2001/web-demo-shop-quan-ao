Women's Relaxed Fit
Perfect your modern workwear style in the Women’s Relaxed Fit Cropped Work Shirt. As part of the Clean Utility Core Collection, this Work Shirt boasts a straightforward iteration of current workwear styling using archival fabrics reminiscent of the Factory trend from the 1940s and 1950s. The fit features a boxy cropped silhouette that leaves enough room to move comfortably throughout the day. Hitting right at the waist, the length isn’t too short and will pair flawlessly with Dickies High Rise Wide Leg Work Pants to create your go-to uniform for the season. The front pockets include button closures to heighten your utilitarian look while the Dickies tricolor logo is finished at the front and center to show off your pride for authentic American workwear.

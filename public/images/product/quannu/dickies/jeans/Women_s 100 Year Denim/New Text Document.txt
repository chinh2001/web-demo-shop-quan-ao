Women's 100 Year Denim
A nod to all those who have simultaneously helped build Dickies while also building our world, our 100 Year Collection celebrates our collective coming of age. We've been around a long time; long enough to be passed down through generations. We couldn't be more honored to have accompanied farmers and tradespeople and artists in their journeys of becoming. Generations of people who were Made In Dickies. Dickies Women's 100 Year Denim Jean celebrates that heritage with classic double knee construction and Dickies lasting quality and durability. Pair it with the Denim 100 Year Chore Coat and there will be no question about what you stand for: independence, grit, and hard work resting on the shoulders of the generations who laid the foundation before you.

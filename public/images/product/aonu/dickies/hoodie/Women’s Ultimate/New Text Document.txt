Dickies understands the demands of your dynamic workday. When you’re leading the charge in your field, you can’t be slowed down by sub-par protection. That’s why Dickies ProTect Full Zip Hoodies raises the bar when it comes to performance. Constructed from a cutting-edge tightly woven Weather Weave™ fleece for extra durable wind and water-resistant fabrication, the exterior also features a PFC free Durable Water Repellent (DWR) finish that raises the stakes when it comes to water resistance. When working with machinery, the patented SafeCinch™ internal mechanism adds the benefit of adjusting the drawcords through the interior of the large front pockets, allowing your hands to stay protected and preventing you from getting caught up as you navigate the most protective cinched fit. Plus, the contoured hood and higher neckline give you added coverage to safeguard you against the extreme conditions and protect you from debris. Reflective detailing on the zipper trim enhances your visibility in all work lighting environments. The drop tail and rib knit adaptable hem and cuffs offer a comfortable fit while keeping the elements out. You’ll find added utility with a hidden cell phone pocket at the front pocketing, so you don’t second guess securing your valuables. Complete with a large Dickies screen-printed logo to raised heat transfer Dickies logo on the left sleeve and dyed to match logo label on the front left pocket, there will be no mistaking your choice in superior performance workwear.

DISNEY BAMBI GRAPHIC SWEATER
A SUPER SOFT DISNEY SWEATSHIRT WITH NOSTALGIC BAMBI VIBES.
Bambi finally found his feet in the film, but he also helped forge a career path for women. This sweatshirt is a tribute to the first ever female animator to be credited on a Disney movie. The woman who helped create the famous fawn. ​
​
Created in partnership with the Better Cotton Initiative and crafted from plush French terry, with clean, cuffed finishes, it has vintage collegiate lettering to offset the embroidered Bambi logo on the front. This sweatshirt serves up a serious dose of Disney nostalgia, but it's also a reminder that anything is possible.​
​
This cotton product supports more sustainable cotton farming.

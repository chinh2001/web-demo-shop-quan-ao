ADICOLOR SHATTERED TREFOIL WHEEL SWEATSHIRT
A CASUAL CREWNECK THAT REIMAGINES AN ADIDAS ICON.
See the Trefoil from an entirely new angle. Even when it's upside-down and deconstructed, the three-leaved symbol always stands for unity in diversity. This sweatshirt is just the latest iteration of adidas Originals heritage. The French terry fabric feels super plush inside, just like your old favourite.

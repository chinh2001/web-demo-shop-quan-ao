DESIGNED FOR GAMEDAY FULL-ZIP JACKET
A SLIM-FITTING JACKET MADE IN PART WITH RECYCLED MATERIALS.
You're in the zone. Nothing needs to interfere with that. And if you're still getting there, this adidas jacket helps. Zip it up, toss up the hood and turn into yourself. The moments before the game are just as important as the moments during it, and this jacket honours that completely.

Made in part with recycled content generated from production waste, e.g. cutting scraps, and post-consumer household waste to avoid the larger environmental impact of producing virgin content.

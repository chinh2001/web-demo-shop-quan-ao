ADICOLOR SHATTERED TREFOIL CREWNECK SWEATSHIRT
A CASUAL SWEATSHIRT THAT REIMAGINES AN ADIDAS ICON.
Who doesn't love a good remix? Chopped up and reconstructed, the Trefoil logo on this adidas sweatshirt stands out with modern energy. But even with the new look? It has the same meaning. Originality. Creativity. Two things that come easy when you're wrapped in plush French terry.

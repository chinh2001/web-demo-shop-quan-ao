Product Details
Redefine your uniform workwear style in Dickies Striped Pocket Tee. As part of the Clean Utility Core Collection, this regular fit striped crew neck tee offers a modern take on clean looking workwear pieces inspired by the Factory and Garage trends of the 1940s and 1950s. Constructed from a heavyweight Cotton/Poly jersey blend, this fabric has been elevated to provide a softer hand feel. The front pocket is perfectly placed with a pencil division and Dickies logo label to celebrate the authentic utility you expect in your workwear style.

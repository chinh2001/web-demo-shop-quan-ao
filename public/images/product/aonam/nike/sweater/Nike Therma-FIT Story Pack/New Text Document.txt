The Nike Therma-FIT


 Top is made from soft double-knit stretch fabric for warmth and mobility. A large front pocket gives you a place to warm your hands in cooler weather, while the zipped front pocket lets you securely stash your phone, keys and other small essentials. Bright graphics on both sides are inspired by the balance of the mental and physical strength needed to support yourself before during and after your daily grind.

the 100 Year
Always laser focused on offering workwear with unparalleled durability, comfort, and value, Dickies celebrates its centenary this year with the 100 Year Collection. For 100 years, we have been honored to support the spirit and hard work of the American worker, in all its expressions. Dickies Men's 100 Year Double Knee Denim Jean celebrates that, offering classic durable construction with denim styling. The perfectly sized front and back pockets, along with the slick phone pocket, are intentionally designed to carry exactly what you need. With a relaxed fit, traditional herringbone print lining the pockets and contrast stitching throughout, match it with the 100 Year Chore Coat for a uniform that will carry you through thick and thin.

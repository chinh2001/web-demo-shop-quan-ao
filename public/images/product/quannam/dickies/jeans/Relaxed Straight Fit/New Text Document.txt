Relaxed Straight Fit
Step into Dickies’ Relaxed Straight Fit 5-Pocket Denim Jean and you’ll be hooked. The heavyweight, 100% cotton jean gives you years of durability and a wash-and-go material. The relaxed fit provides extra room in the seat and thigh—making it comfortable for bending and kneeling. Deep front pockets, back pockets and a coin pocket will hold all the supplies you need, while the 7 keystone belt loops support a work belt for additional storage.

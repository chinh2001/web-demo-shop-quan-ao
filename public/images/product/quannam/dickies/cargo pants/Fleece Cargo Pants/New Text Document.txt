Fleece Cargo Pants
Part of our Street Utility Collection, Dickies Men's Fleece Cargo Pants promise to overdeliver. Not only are they designed to be comfortable like loungewear and styled like streetwear, but they are constructed with a non-toxic water repellant finish that will also keep you dry. Whether you find yourself in unsettled weather or your work is messy business, they've got your back. Secure cargo pockets with intentionally crafted storage, along with perfectly flexible elastic at the waist and ankles, will keep you overdelivering on your promises, too.

Performance Workwear
Dickies' Performance Workwear GDT Premium Pants instill the confidence you need to master even the toughest tasks. The protection provided in these trousers is unyielding, with durable Cordura fabricated details found in the back and cargo pockets, knee pad pouches, and kick plates. Reflective hits give you the visibility you need to maintain personal safety while the wide reinforced belt loops ensure hardwearing support. The crotch-gusset provides freedom of movement while maintaining comfort to get you through your workday.

Fit: The fit is similar to our Dickies regular fit with a slight taper at the knee for added articulation/ease of movement when wearing knee pads. The bottom openings allows for the pants to fit over your work boots. The back rise give the coverage needed while spending more time on your knees.

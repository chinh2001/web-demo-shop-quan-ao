GRAPHICS UNITED SWEAT PANTS
ULTRA-SOFT SWEAT PANTS WITH A MESSAGE OF UNITY.
United we can do it all. These adidas sweat pants serve as a reminder to use sport to bond with others, no matter where they're from. The upside-down Trefoil logo combines with a globe to stand for peace and unity, a meaningful and powerful message you can show off with your favourite shirt or jacket.
